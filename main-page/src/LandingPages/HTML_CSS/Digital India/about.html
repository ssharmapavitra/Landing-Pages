                <p><b>Digital India is a flagship programme of the Government of India with a vision to transform India
                        into
                        a
                        digitally empowered society and knowledge economy.</b><br><br>
                    E-governance initiatives in India took a broader dimension in the mid 1990s for wider sectoral
                    applications
                    with emphasis on citizen-centric services. The major ICT initiatives of the Government included,
                    inter
                    alia,
                    some major projects, such as railway computerization, land record computerisation etc., which
                    focused
                    mainly
                    on the development of information systems. Later on, many states started ambitious individual
                    e-governance
                    projects aimed at providing electronic services to citizens.<br>
                    Though these e-governance projects were citizen-centric, they could make less than the desired
                    impact
                    due to
                    their limited features. The isolated and less interactive systems revealed major gaps that were
                    thwarting
                    the successful adoption of e-governance along the entire spectrum of governance. They clearly
                    pointed
                    towards the need for a more comprehensive planning and implementation for the infrastructure
                    required to
                    be
                    put in place, interoperability issues to be addressed etc., to establish a more connected
                    government.<br><br>

                    <b>e-Kranti : National e-Governance Plan 2.0</b><br><br>

                    The national level e-governance programme called National e-Governance Plan (NeGP) was initiaited in
                    2006.
                    There were 31 Mission Mode Projects under National e-Governance Plan covering a wide range of
                    domains
                    viz.
                    agriculture, land records, health, education, passports, police, courts, municipalities, commercial
                    taxes
                    and treasuries etc. 24 Mission Mode Projects have been implemented and started delivering either
                    full or
                    partial range of envisaged services.<br>

                    Considering the shortcomings in National e-Governance Plan that included lack of integration amongst
                    Government applications and databases, low degree of government process re-engineering, scope for
                    leveraging
                    emerging technologies like mobile and cloud etc., the Government of India approved e-Kranti
                    programme
                    with
                    the vision of “Transforming e-Governance for Transforming Governance”.<br>

                    All new and ongoing egovernance projects as well as the existing projects, which are being revamped,
                    should
                    now follow the key principles of e-Kranti namely ‘Transformation and not Translation’, ‘Integrated
                    Services
                    and not Individual Services’, ‘Government Process Reengineering (GPR) to be mandatory in every MMP’,
                    ‘ICT
                    Infrastructure on Demand’, ‘Cloud by Default’, ‘Mobile First’, ‘Fast Tracking Approvals’, ‘Mandating
                    Standards and Protocols’, ‘Language Localization’, ‘National GIS (Geo-Spatial Information System)’,
                    ‘Security and Electronic Data Preservation’.<br>

                    The portfolio of Mission Mode Projects has increased from 31 to 44 MMPs. Many new social sector
                    projects
                    namely Women and Child Development, Social Benefits, Financial Inclusion, Urban Governance eBhasha
                    etc.,
                    have been added as new MMPs under e-Kranti.

                                        A key component under this vision is high speed internet as a core utility to

                                        online delivery of various services. It is planned to set up enabling

                                undertaken
                                by
                                various State Governments and Central Ministries to usher in an era of e-governance.
                                Sustained
                                efforts have been made at multiple levels to improve the delivery of public services and
                                simplify the process of accessing them. E-governance in India has steadily evolved from
                                computerization of Government Departments to initiatives that encapsulate the finer
                                points
                                of
                                Governance, such as citizen centricity, service orientation and transparency.<br>

                                The National e-Governance Plan (NeGP) was approved in 2006 to take a holistic view of
                                e-governance initiatives across the country, integrating them into a collective vision.
                                Around
                                this idea, a massive countrywide infrastructure reaching down to the remotest of
                                villages is
                                being developed, and large-scale digitization of records is taking place to enable easy
                                and
                                reliable access over the internet. The ultimate objective was to make all government
                                services
                                accessible to the common man in his locality, through common service delivery outlets,
                                and
                                ensure efficiency, transparency, and reliability of such services at affordable costs to
                                realise
                                the basic needs of the common man".<br>

                                Six elements are crucial for ensuring that governance and services are made available on
                                demand

                    India
                    is an
                    umbrella
                    programme that covers multiple Government Ministries and Departments. It weaves together a large
                    number
                    of ideas and thoughts into a single, comprehensive vision so that each of them can be implemented as
                    part of a larger goal.

                    Each individual element stands on its own, but is also part of the larger picture. Digital India is
                    to
                    be implemented by the entire Government with overall coordination being done by the Department of
                    Electronics and Information Technology (DeitY).

                    Digital India aims to provide the much needed thrust to the nine pillars of growth areas, namely
                    Broadband Highways, Universal Access to Mobile Connectivity, Public Internet Access Programme,
                    e-Governance: Reforming Government through Technology, e-Kranti - Electronic Delivery of Services,
                    Information for All, Electronics Manufacturing, IT for Jobs and Early Harvest Programmes. Each of
                    these
                    areas is a complex programme in itself and cuts across multiple Ministries and Departments.<br><br>

                All the initiatives, including establishing and expanding core ICT infrastructure, delivery of services
                ...etc under the Digital India programme have definitive completion time targets. Majority of the
                initiatives are planned to be realized within the next three years. The initiatives planned for early
                completion (“Early Harvest Programmes”) and citizen communication initiatives (“Information for All”)
                have already started going live and are being completed.

                The Digital India programme aims at pulling together many existing schemes. These schemes will be
                restructured, revamped and re-focused and will be implemented in a synchronized manner. Many elements
                are only process improvements with minimal cost implications. The common branding of programmes as
                Digital India highlights their transformative impact. While implementing this programme, there would be
                wider consultations across government, industry, civil society, and citizens to discuss various issues
                to arrive at innovative solutions for achieving the desired outcomes of Digital India. DeitY has already
                launched a digital platform named as “myGov” (http://mygov.in/) to facilitate collaborative and
                participative governance. Moreover, several consultations and workshops have been organized to discuss
                the implementation approach of the vision areas of Digital India.
